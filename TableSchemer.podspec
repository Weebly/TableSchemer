  s.description  = <<-DESC
TableSchemer is a framework for building static interactive table views. Interface Builder provides a great way to build out static table views, but not everyone uses interface builder, and adding interactivity to these table views is difficult. Writing interactive static table views traditionally is a tiresome task due to working with index paths, and having multiple delegate methods to handle configuration, sizing, and selection handling. They're also a huge pain to maintain when the need to reorder them comes as you need to update the index paths in all those locations.
